## üìä Training Performance

### Dataset Overview
- **Total samples**: 34,575  
- **Class distribution**:
  - `owner`: 8,750 samples (25.3%)
  - `pet`: 4,575 samples (13.2%)
  - `other person`: 12,500 samples (36.2%)
  - `background`: 8,750 samples (25.3%)

> üì¶ **Dataset Details**:
> - ~30 seconds of cat video for `pet`
> - ~30 seconds of general walking around the house for `background`
> - ~2:20 minutes of the owner in various lighting and locations for `owner`
> - 2,500 random photos from the [Human Faces dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashwingupta3012/human-faces?resource=download) and other diverse images for `other person`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Fast convergence within 10 epochs and very low final loss could indicate overfitting ‚Äî especially due to relatively limited video-based data for certain classes. The model may not generalize well to entirely unseen backgrounds, different pet photos, or lighting conditions without further fine-tuning on a larger and more diverse dataset.

## üß™ Failure Analysis

### Common Edge Cases

1. **Pet Detection**:
   - Accuracy drops sharply when <30% of the pet's body is visible.
   - Low lighting or blurry scenes reduce confidence by ~40%.

2. **Person Identification**:
   - Needs ‚â•92% confidence to reliably classify "owner" vs "other person".
   - False positives occur with reflections (e.g., mirrors or glass).
   - Drops in confidence and misclassifications when dataset lacks diversity in "other person" examples.
