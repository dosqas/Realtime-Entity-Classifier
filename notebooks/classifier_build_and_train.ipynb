    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency** ⚡: MobileNetV2 is designed specifically for mobile and edge devices, making it computationally efficient while maintaining good accuracy\n",
    "- **Depthwise Separable Convolutions** 🧩: Uses a factorized form of standard convolutions that drastically reduces parameter count and computational cost\n",
    "- **Inverted Residuals** 🔄: Unlike traditional residual blocks, MobileNetV2 uses inverted residuals with linear bottlenecks, which help preserve information flow while keeping the model lightweight\n",
    "- **Pre-trained Knowledge** 🧠: ImageNet pre-training provides the model with powerful feature extraction capabilities that can transfer well to new domains\n",
    "- **Size-Performance Tradeoff** ⚖️: Offers an excellent balance between model size (~14M parameters) and performance for real-time or resource-constrained applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transfer Learning Approach 🔄\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Freeze the feature extraction layers\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameter Selection Strategy 🔍\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `filter(lambda p: p.requires_grad, model.parameters())` to select only trainable parameters. This is critical for our transfer learning approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency Boost** ⚡: By optimizing only the classifier parameters ( ~few thousand) instead of the entire model ( ~14 million), we drastically reduce computation time and memory requirements\n",
    "- **Focused Learning** 🔭: Updates are restricted to the task-specific components (the classifier), leaving the pre-trained feature extractor untouched\n",
    "- **Lambda Function Elegance** 💻: The lambda function creates a clean, one-line filter that selects parameters where `requires_grad=True`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Adam? 🤔\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) combines the benefits of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adaptive Learning Rates** 📊: Automatically adjusts learning rates for each parameter based on historical gradients\n",
    "- **Momentum** 🏎️: Accelerates convergence by adding a fraction of the previous update direction\n",
    "- **RMSProp Integration** 📉: Adapts learning rates based on the average of recent magnitudes of gradients\n",
    "- **Sparse Gradient Handling** 🌵: Performs well even when gradients are sparse or noisy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hyperparameter Choices 🎛️\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learning Rate (5e-5)** 🏁: \n",
    "  - A smaller learning rate typically used for fine-tuning pre-trained models.\n",
    "  - Helps ensure that the model updates its weights gradually, preventing large, unstable changes.\n",

    "  - Implements L2 regularization by penalizing large weights\n",
    "  - Helps prevent overfitting by encouraging the model to use smaller weights\n",
    "  - Value of 1e-5 is conservative, providing gentle regularization\n",

    "#### Label Smoothing (0.1) 🥤\n",
    "\n",
    "Label smoothing is a regularization technique that modifies the target distribution:\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Confidence Penalty** 📉: Discourages the model from becoming too confident in its predictions\n",
    "- **Overfitting Prevention** 🛡️: Makes the model less likely to memorize training data noise or errors\n",
    "- **Class Imbalance Handling** ⚖️: Particularly valuable for our use case with potential class imbalance (may have more background frames than pet frames)\n",
    "- **Value Selection (0.1)** 🎚️: \n",
    "  - 0.1 is a moderate smoothing value that provides regularization benefits\n",
    "  - High enough to prevent overconfidence\n",
    "  - Low enough to maintain class separation\n",
    "  \n",

    "## 🎥📸 VideoImageDataset Class: A Comprehensive Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The `VideoImageDataset` class is a custom PyTorch `Dataset` implementation designed for handling **mixed media (videos 🎥 and images 📸)** in machine learning classification tasks. Although initially designed for person/pet 🐕 classification, it is general enough to apply to various domains like surveillance, smart home applications, or content moderation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class demonstrates advanced data engineering strategies to improve efficiency, flexibility, and robustness during model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Core Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "This class addresses several key challenges in multimedia datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mixed Media Handling** 🔄  \n",
    "   Combines both video frames and image files into a unified dataset. No need to treat them separately during model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory Efficiency** 🧠  \n",
    "   Lazy loads frames only when needed and uses an internal cache to avoid repeated expensive disk I/O.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Augmentation** 🎨  \n",
    "   Augmentation strategies can be applied consistently across both images and video frames, which improves generalization and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Robust Error Handling** 🛡️  \n",
    "   Can skip unreadable or corrupted files without interrupting training — useful when datasets come from diverse or noisy sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏛️ Class Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔧 Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructor parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data_sources`: Dict mapping class names (e.g., \"pet\", \"owner\") to file paths (video/image)\n",
    "- `label_mapping`: Maps each class name to a unique integer (used as label)\n",
    "- `transform`: Optional torchvision transform pipeline (e.g., Resize, Normalize)\n",
    "- `augment`: Enables or disables augmentation (`True/False`)\n",
    "- `num_augments`: Number of augmentations to generate per frame/image (helps simulate diversity)\n",
    "- `max_frames_per_video`: Limits how many frames are sampled per video\n",
    "- `frame_interval`: Controls temporal sampling by picking every nth frame\n",
    "- `cache_size`: Max number of decoded frames to keep in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization flow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 📥 Stores all input arguments  \n",
    "2. 🧠 Initializes internal memory-efficient cache (FIFO by default)  \n",
    "3. 🗂️ Builds an internal index of data with paths, types, labels, and metadata  \n",
    "4. 🧪 Validates all media files (image size, video readability)  \n",
    "5. 📊 Reports useful statistics (class distribution, number of samples, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📂 Data Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `_index_all_data()`\n",
    "\n",
    "This core method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iterates over each class label in `data_sources`\n",
    "- Differentiates between video and image paths\n",
    "- Indexes each file with a type tag (image or video)\n",
    "- Validates existence/readability early to avoid runtime errors\n",
    "- Collects metadata: dimensions, number of frames, FPS, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `_index_image(path)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✔️ Confirms file exists and is readable\n",
    "- 🖼️ Loads dimensions and filters out corrupt or extremely small files\n",
    "- 🧾 Records metadata to avoid reloading this information later\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `_index_video(path)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✔️ Uses `cv2.VideoCapture` to extract video info\n",
    "- ⏳ Computes duration, total frames, and ensures file is valid\n",
    "- 🎯 Selects which frames to use (based on the sampling strategy)\n",
    "- 📌 Saves metadata for lazy loading later\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Data Sampling Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Three customizable sampling strategies for videos:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Uniform Sampling** ⏱️  \n",
    "   Evenly spaced frames (default) — useful for general-purpose training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Front-Weighted Sampling** ⏩  \n",
    "   Biases frame selection toward the beginning — useful for intro-heavy clips.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Random Sampling** 🎲  \n",
    "   Randomly selects a subset of frames — adds stochasticity to training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can be set via a sampling policy attribute or parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📤 Data Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `__getitem__(index)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🧮 Computes actual sample from the internal index  \n",
    "- 🔍 Loads the specific frame or image  \n",
    "- 🧠 Checks if it's already cached; if not, reads and caches it  \n",
    "- 🎨 Applies augmentation if enabled  \n",
    "- 🧪 Applies base transform (resizing, normalization, etc.)  \n",
    "- 🏷️ Returns a `(tensor_image, label)` pair\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🖼️ Frame Loading Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `_load_video_frame(video_path, frame_index)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Checks frame cache  \n",
    "- If missing, reads frame with OpenCV and adds to cache  \n",
    "- Converts BGR → RGB and normalizes  \n",
    "- Handles any reading or decoding errors gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `_load_image(image_path)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also supports caching  \n",
    "- Performs format conversion and integrity check  \n",
    "- Skips unreadable files and optionally returns dummy data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎨 Data Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Augmentations can simulate realistic conditions, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Color Augmentations** 🌈  \n",
    "   - Brightness/contrast shifts  \n",
    "   - Hue/saturation jitter  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Geometric Augmentations** 📐  \n",
    "   - Random crops, flips, rotations  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mixed Augmentations** 🎭  \n",
    "   - Combine both color and spatial transforms  \n",
    "\n",
    "These can be toggled or extended with `torchvision.transforms`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💾 Cache Management\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🗃️ Internal dict stores decoded frames\n",
    "- 🔁 Uses FIFO eviction when full (to save memory)\n",
    "- 📉 Tracks hit/miss rate for performance diagnostics\n",
    "- 🛠️ Makes repeated accesses much faster (e.g., DataLoader with `num_workers > 0`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Design Choices Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⏳ Lazy Loading  \n",
    "Only loads what you use, when you use it. Saves RAM and GPU memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 💾 Why Use a Cache?  \n",
    "Reading from disk is slow — cache helps especially when using augmentation or repeated data access.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎨 Multiple Augmentations  \n",
    "Improves model robustness and performance across unseen scenarios or lighting conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📊 Statistics Tracking  \n",
    "Important for debugging, understanding class balance, and verifying dataset health.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🛡️ Robust Error Handling  \n",
    "Doesn’t crash on corrupted data — reports it and optionally replaces with dummy image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏆 Practical Applications  \n",
    "\n",
    "Great for:  \n",
    "1. 🐕 Pet/Owner Recognition  \n",
    "2. 🔒 Security Systems  \n",
    "3. 🏠 Smart Home Applications  \n",

    "\n",
    "Before training kicks off:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model to Device** 📦  \n",
    "  Send the model to GPU (`cuda`) or CPU using `model.to(device)` for efficient computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loss Function** 🎯  \n",
    "  We're using `CrossEntropyLoss` – perfect for multi-class classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimizer** ⚙️  \n",
    "  `Adam` is our optimizer of choice, with a customizable learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Device Check** 💻  \n",
    "  Automatically detects if CUDA is available and switches device accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 Epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "Training runs over **`num_epochs`** (default: `10`).  \n",
    "Each epoch = **1 full pass** through the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple epochs help the model gradually improve its performance through weight updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Metrics Tracked\n",
    "\n",
    "We're collecting and visualizing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loss** 📉 → Measures prediction error (lower is better).\n",
    "- **Accuracy** ✅ → Percentage of correct predictions.\n",

    "### 🔄 Inside Each Epoch\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what happens **for each epoch**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set Model to Training Mode** 🏋️  \n",
