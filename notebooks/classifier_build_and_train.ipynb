    "- **Depthwise Separable Convolutions** 🧩: Uses a factorized form of standard convolutions that drastically reduces parameter count and computational cost\n",
    "- **Inverted Residuals** 🔄: Unlike traditional residual blocks, MobileNetV2 uses inverted residuals with linear bottlenecks, which help preserve information flow while keeping the model lightweight\n",
    "- **Pre-trained Knowledge** 🧠: ImageNet pre-training provides the model with powerful feature extraction capabilities that can transfer well to new domains\n",
    "- **Size-Performance Tradeoff** ⚖️: Offers an excellent balance between model size (~14M parameters) and performance for real-time or resource-constrained applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transfer Learning Approach 🔄\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Freeze the feature extraction layers\n",
    "for param in model.parameters():\n",
    "    param.requires_grad = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Dropout (0.2)** 🎭:\n",
    "  - Implements regularization by randomly deactivating 20% of neurons during training\n",
    "  - Prevents co-adaptation of neurons (neurons becoming too dependent on each other)\n",
    "  - Forces the network to learn redundant representations, improving generalization\n",
    "  - Rate of 0.2 is conservative, providing regularization while preserving most information flow\n",
    "  - Particularly important for this task since the dataset likely contains many similar frames of the same subjects\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output Layer (4 neurons)** 🎬:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Parameter Selection Strategy 🔍\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `filter(lambda p: p.requires_grad, model.parameters())` to select only trainable parameters. This is critical for our transfer learning approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency Boost** ⚡: By optimizing only the classifier parameters ( ~few thousand) instead of the entire model ( ~14 million), we drastically reduce computation time and memory requirements\n",
    "- **Focused Learning** 🔭: Updates are restricted to the task-specific components (the classifier), leaving the pre-trained feature extractor untouched\n",
    "- **Lambda Function Elegance** 💻: The lambda function creates a clean, one-line filter that selects parameters where `requires_grad=True`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Adam? 🤔\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) combines the benefits of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adaptive Learning Rates** 📊: Automatically adjusts learning rates for each parameter based on historical gradients\n",
    "- **Momentum** 🏎️: Accelerates convergence by adding a fraction of the previous update direction\n",
    "- **RMSProp Integration** 📉: Adapts learning rates based on the average of recent magnitudes of gradients\n",
    "- **Sparse Gradient Handling** 🌵: Performs well even when gradients are sparse or noisy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hyperparameter Choices 🎛️\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learning Rate (5e-5)** 🏁: \n",
    "  - A smaller learning rate typically used for fine-tuning pre-trained models.\n",
    "  - Helps ensure that the model updates its weights gradually, preventing large, unstable changes.\n",
    "  - Useful when working with pre-trained weights, as it allows the model to make subtle adjustments without drastically altering the learned features.\n",
    "  - Small enough to avoid overshooting the optimal solution, promoting stable convergence, especially in later training stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weight Decay (1e-5)** 🌱: \n",
    "  - Implements L2 regularization by penalizing large weights\n",
    "  - Helps prevent overfitting by encouraging the model to use smaller weights\n",
    "  - Value of 1e-5 is conservative, providing gentle regularization\n",

    "#### Label Smoothing (0.1) 🥤\n",
    "\n",
    "Label smoothing is a regularization technique that modifies the target distribution:\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Confidence Penalty** 📉: Discourages the model from becoming too confident in its predictions\n",
    "- **Overfitting Prevention** 🛡️: Makes the model less likely to memorize training data noise or errors\n",
    "- **Class Imbalance Handling** ⚖️: Particularly valuable for our use case with potential class imbalance (may have more background frames than pet frames)\n",
    "- **Value Selection (0.1)** 🎚️: \n",
    "  - 0.1 is a moderate smoothing value that provides regularization benefits\n",
    "  - High enough to prevent overconfidence\n",
    "  - Low enough to maintain class separation\n",
    "  \n",

    "## 📦 DataLoader and Dataset Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before training our model, we need to properly load and preprocess the image data. This is handled using PyTorch’s `ImageFolder` and `DataLoader` utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🖼️ Image Preprocessing\n",
    "We define a series of transformations to ensure consistency and improve model performance:\n",
    "- **Resize**: All images are resized to a fixed dimension of **224x224** pixels. This is a common size for CNNs and ensures a uniform input shape.\n",
    "- **ToTensor**: Images are converted into PyTorch tensors, enabling them to be processed by the model.\n",
    "- **Normalize**: Pixel values are normalized using the mean and standard deviation from the ImageNet dataset:\n",
    "  - Mean: `[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]`\n",
    "  - Standard Deviation: `[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`\n",
    "  This helps with model convergence and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗂️ Dataset Structure\n",
    "The dataset is organized using folders representing each class. Each subdirectory (e.g., `nobody`, `pet`, `owner`, `other_person`) contains images specific to that class. PyTorch’s `ImageFolder` automatically maps these folders to class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ DataLoader Creation\n",
    "We create two `DataLoader` objects:\n",
    "- **Training Loader**: Loads the dataset in shuffled batches of 32 images to ensure randomness and improve generalization.\n",
    "- **Validation Loader**: Loads the validation data without shuffling, maintaining the order for consistent evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `num_workers=4` setting allows data loading to happen in parallel for better performance.\n"

    "## 🧠 Model Training Loop Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "This section explains the logic behind training our deep learning model using PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 Epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "We train the model over **100 epochs** — one epoch is a complete pass over the entire training dataset. Repeating this allows the model to learn gradually and improve its performance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Metrics Tracked\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, we monitor two key metrics every epoch:\n",
    "- **Loss** (📉): Measures how far off the model’s predictions are from the actual labels.\n",
    "- **Accuracy** (✅): Tells us how many predictions were correct out of the total.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are stored in `train_losses` and `train_accuracies` lists to help us visualize progress later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 Training Steps Per Epoch\n",
    "\n",
    "Each epoch consists of several steps that happen for every batch of images:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set model to training mode** 🏋️  \n",
    "   Enables dropout and batch normalization, which behave differently during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loop through batches of data** 📦  \n",
    "   We use `tqdm` to wrap our DataLoader, which gives us a nice real-time progress bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Zero out gradients** 🧽  \n",
    "   We reset gradients using `optimizer.zero_grad()` so that past gradient values don’t accumulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Forward pass** 📤  \n",
    "   The input images are passed through the model to generate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Calculate loss** 📏  \n",
    "   We use a loss function (CrossEntropyLoss) to compute how wrong the model was.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Backward pass** 🧮  \n",
    "   We call `.backward()` on the loss to compute gradients of the model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Update weights** 🔧  \n",
    "   The optimizer (Adam) updates the model parameters based on the gradients with `optimizer.step()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Track loss and accuracy** 🧾  \n",
    "   We add the loss to a running total and count how many predictions were correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 After Each Epoch\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all batches are processed in an epoch:\n",
    "- We calculate the **average loss** and **accuracy** for that epoch.\n",
    "- We print this info to the console.\n",
    "- We append the values to our tracking lists for later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💾 Saving the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of training, we save the learned weights of our model to a file `entity_classifier.pth`. This allows us to reuse the model later without retraining it from scratch! 💡\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 Plotting Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `matplotlib` to generate two side-by-side plots:\n",
    "- **Training Loss per Epoch** (in red)\n",
    "- **Training Accuracy per Epoch** (in green)\n",
    "\n",
    "These plots visually show how well the model learned over time — ideally, loss should decrease while accuracy increases! 📉📈"
